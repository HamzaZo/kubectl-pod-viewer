### How to use `pod-viewer`

### Installation

`pod-viewer` is designed to be used as `kubectl` plugin. 

Hence, you need to make sure you have [krew installed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/#installation) and then you can install `pod-viewer` as follows:
```
$ kubectl krew install pod-viewer
```

If the installation fails, check if `krew` is available on your local system and also, make sure you're using the most recent index (run `kubectl krew update`) to ensure this.
